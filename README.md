group project

## brief

As a group we decided to make a hiking application 

The application will let the user choose their level of difficulty for the hike baised off gradient of climb, randomise a pre made card for showing the hike that they are going on and the map with a path to follow. we used leafletjs api for the map features and Thunderforest api for the map tile.

following the user completing the hike they are then asked to input their details and a small blurb on how the hike was, this is saved to local storage and will eventually be posted to a blog.
